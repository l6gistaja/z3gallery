# Configuration and data file for z3gallery, which creates HTML indexes for video directories
# Additional software needed: perl, ffmpeg, fdupes*, $webbrowser* (* - optional)

############## Rules:
# 1. Lines with '#' in the beginning are comments;
# 2. Lines in format '$variable_pi = 3.14' are configuration parameters
# 3. Lines in format 'filename_in_vid_dir_no_whitespaces_allowed Text describing the video(s)'
#    will add video's link and thumbnail (to the end of $index_html);
# 4. Empty lines will be ignored.
# 5. def=... in the end of comment/description means default value
# 6. ALL texts must be encoded in UTF-8!

############## Configuration what you usually need:

# title of the video gallery; def=V
$title = V

# delete vids if ffmpeg isnt able to generate thumbnail (BE CAREFUL!)? def=no
$autoclean = no

# order files by file's 'name' or saving 'time'; def=time
$order_by = time

# delete duplicate files (needs fdupes)? def=no
$delete_duplicates = no

############## Configuration what you don't need often:

# thumbnails subdirectory; def=g/
$gallery_dir = g/

# original videos subdirectory; def=v/
$vid_dir = v/

### width and height def's should be dividable by 2 (or was it 4?)
# thumbnail's width in pixels; def=160
$width = 160
# thumbnail's height in pixels; def=120
$height = 120

# number of thumbnails in one row; def=4
$jmax = 4

# thumbnail's name consists video's fileextension? def=yes
$tn_strategy_long = yes

# if you wanna see thumbnails gallery, open this file in browser; def=index.html
$index_html = index.html

# web browser executable what you use for seeing and playing the gallery
$webbrowser = konqueror

# time from beginning of a clip to take an snapshot/thumbnail; def=00:00:01
# NB! if it is more then default 00:00:01, it also takes more time to find that place!
$snapshot_time = 00:00:01

# link to Flash player
$flashplayer_html = flashplayer.html

# configuration export file for Javascript
$z3_export_js = js/z3_export.js

# videofile's descriptions (nothing happens when this file is missing)
# file's format:
#<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
#<descriptions>
#<d filename="...">
#<label>...</label>
#<name>...</name>
#<txt>...</txt>
#</d>
#</descriptions>
# Perl package XML::Simple required
$descriptions_file = descriptions.xml

########### Put your video descriptions here (as described in Rule #3)
# (if video's filename is not found in $vid_dir, nothing happens):
